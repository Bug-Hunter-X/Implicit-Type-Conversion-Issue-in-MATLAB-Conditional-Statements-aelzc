# Implicit Type Conversion Bug in MATLAB

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in MATLAB related to implicit type conversion within conditional statements.  The bug arises from MATLAB's flexible type system, which can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.

The `bug.m` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.m` file offers a corrected version, highlighting best practices for handling type conversions to prevent this type of error.

This issue is relevant to developers working with MATLAB and need to understand how implicit type conversions affect conditional logic and other MATLAB operations.  The bug is particularly relevant in cases where precise comparison of values is required.
